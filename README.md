# Travel-PiHole-and-PiVPN
My process of setting up a RaspberryPi and a Travel Router with PiHole and PiVPN


When I first saw this project online I was immediately drawn to it since all I needed to get to finish setting this up was just a travel sized wireless router. Other than that I already had multiple raspberry pis sitting around not doing anything. Another reason that I chose to approach this project is because as I have gone throught this line of work and learning about how more and more companies are selling data and how easy it is to find people on public wifi, I started thinking about a future trip I am going on and how I want to protect my data an myself while working on my computer while in said trip.

1. I started by collecting all the nessacarry equipment for me to contruct this project.
   - 2 Raspberry Pi 4s or Pi Zero W V2
   - Linksys A750 Travel Router
   - USB C power hubs or cables
   - Access to the Internet
   - Micro USB cable or Charger
2. To start I install the non desktop version of the latest RaspberryPi OS on to both of the Pis
3. After that we need to install PiHole on one and PiVPN on the other.
