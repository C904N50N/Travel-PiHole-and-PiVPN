# Travel-PiHole-and-PiVPN

This is my process of setting up a RaspberryPi and a Travel Router with PiHole and PiVPN.

## Motivation

When I first saw this project online, I was immediately drawn to it. All I needed to finish setting this up was just a travel-sized wireless router. I already had multiple Raspberry Pis sitting around not doing anything. As I have gone through this line of work and learned about how more and more companies are selling data and how easy it is to find people on public wifi, I started thinking about a future trip I am going on. I want to protect my data and myself while working on my computer during this trip.

## Equipment

I started by collecting all the necessary equipment for me to construct this project:

- Raspberry Pi 4s or Pi Zero W V2
- Linksys A750 Travel Router
- USB C power hubs or cables
- Access to the Internet
- Micro USB cable or Charger

## Setup

To start, I install the non-desktop version of the latest RaspberryPi OS onto the Pi. After that, we need to install PiHole on one and PiVPN on the other.
