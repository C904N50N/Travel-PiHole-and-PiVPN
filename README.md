# 🌐 Travel-PiHole-and-PiVPN 🌐

This is my journey of setting up a RaspberryPi and a Travel Router with PiHole and PiVPN.

## 🚀 Motivation

When I first stumbled upon this project online, I was immediately captivated. The only missing piece was a travel-sized wireless router. I already had a few Raspberry Pis gathering dust. As I delved deeper into the world of data privacy, I realized how pervasive data selling and public wifi vulnerabilities were. This sparked an idea for an upcoming trip - I wanted to ensure my data and personal information were secure while working on my computer.

## 🛠️ Equipment

I began by gathering all the necessary equipment for this project:

- 🖥️ Raspberry Pi 4s or Pi Zero W V2
  -
- 📶 Linksys A750 Travel Router
  -
- 🔌 USB C power hubs or cables
- 🌐 Access to the Internet
- 📱 Micro USB cable or Charger

## 📋 Setup

The setup process began with installing the non-desktop version of the latest RaspberryPi OS onto the Pi. Following that, PiHole was installed on one device and PiVPN on the other.
